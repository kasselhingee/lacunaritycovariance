TO INSTALL FROM GITHUB USING DEVTOOLS PACKAGE:
library(devtools)
install_github("HingK/racsstats", ref = "release", auth_token = "****")

where auth_token is a personal access token that can be generated here: https://github.com/settings/tokens. Copy it from your browser and use it as the auth_token argument of install_github.
(an access token is required because the repository is private).
