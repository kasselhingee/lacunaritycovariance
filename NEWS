## lacunaritycovariance VERSION 1.1-00
Fixed the numerical features seen in GBL estimates using pair correlation and (uncentred) covariance. These were numerical quadrature issues. gblg() and gblc() now use the cubature package in order for sufficiently accurate integration. These better integration methods take a long time to run. That makes gblcc() the fastest of the new estimators. It doesn't need the higher accuracy numerical integration because centred covariance approaches zero for large vectors.

The default GBL estimator is now the 'pickaH' method for gblcc().

## lacunaritycovariance VERSION 1.0-4

This is the first version of the package 'lacunaritycovariance' released on CRAN. An earlier version of this package appeared with the name 'stationaryracsinference' in the electronic supplements to the paper:
 Hingee K, Baddeley A, Caccetta P, Nair G (2019). Computation of lacunarity from covariance of spatial binary maps. Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics, 24, 264-288. DOI: 10.1007/s13253-019-00351-9.

#### SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
  - package name changed to 'lacunaritycovariance'.

#### BUG FIXES
  - spelling and grammar corrections in help pages.
