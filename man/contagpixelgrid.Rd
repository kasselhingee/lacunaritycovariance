\title{Pixel Adjacency Contagion}
\usage{
contagpixelgrid(xi, obswin, normalise = FALSE)

adjacency(xi, obswin = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xi}{A binary map of an observation of a RACS of interest. See
\code{\link{stationaryracsinference-package}} for details.
If \code{xi} is an owin object it must be of \code{mask} type.}

\item{obswin}{If \code{xi} is an \code{owin} object then \code{obswin} is an
\code{owin} object that specifies the observation window.}

\item{normalise}{If \code{TRUE} will divide result by \eqn{2 ln(2)} and add 1 to make contagion between 0 and 1 for any binary map}
}
\description{
Function for calculating the traditional contagion LPI from a binary map (O'Neill, 1988).
}
\details{
The unnormalised contagion LPI of categorical map is defined as
\deqn{\sum_i \sum_j Pij ln(Pij),} where \eqn{Pij} is the probability of
randomly selected adjacent pixels being in class \eqn{i} and class \eqn{j}
respectively, and \eqn{m} is the number of classes.

Here \eqn{m = 2} as \eqn{xi} is a binary map and we have defined 'adjacent'
pixels using the 4-neighbourhood regime.

Contagion is calculated from an adjacency matrix created using \code{adjacency}.

**What is the `double count' method as described in the
FRAGSTATS manual on adjacency matrix?

\section{Warning}{
 Will fail if map is either all foreground or all background.
