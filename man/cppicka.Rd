\title{Picka's Reduced Window Estimator of Coverage Probability}
\usage{
cppicka(xi, obswin = NULL, setcov_boundarythresh = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xi}{A binary map of an observation of a RACS of interest. See
\code{\link{stationaryracsinference-package}} for details.}

\item{obswin}{If \code{xi} is an \code{owin} object then \code{obswin} is an
\code{owin} object that specifies the observation window.}

\item{setcov_boundarythresh}{Any vector \eqn{v} such that set covariance of the observation window
is smaller than this threshold is given a covariance of NA to avoid instabilities caused by dividing by very small areas,}
}
\value{
An \code{im} object. Pixel values correspond to estimates of the coverage probability
from the subregion of the observation window, \eqn{W}, that is the intersection of \eqn{W} and \eqn{W} shifted by vector \eqn{v}, where \eqn{v} is the pixel location.
}
\description{
This function provides estimates of coverage probability from subsets of the observation window,
 which are a key component of balanced estimators of covariance, centred covariance, pair-correlation and gliding box lacunarity.
}
\details{
The traditional covariance estimator uses less of the observation window than the traditional coverage probability.
Picka (1997, 2000) created new 'balanced' estimators of centred covariance and pair-correlation
that accounted for this difference.
A key component of Picka's estimators is an estimate of the coverage probability from the subregion of the binary map that is
the intersection between \eqn{W} and \eqn{W} shifted by vector \eqn{v}, where \eqn{W} is the observation window (p.~687, Picka, 2000).
If we treat \eqn{X} and \eqn{W} as indicator functions representing the foreground and observation window respectively,
 this coverage probability estimator used by Picka is
\deqn{ \frac{\int X(u) W(u) W(u - v) du} {\int W(u) W(u - v) du}. }{integral(X(u) W(u) W(u - v) du)  /  integral(W(u) W(u - v) du).}

\code{cppicka} produces these estimates for an array of vectors \eqn{v} using fast Fourier transforms.
