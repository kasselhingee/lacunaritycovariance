Description: Functions for non-parametric estimation of 2D RACS from
    observations of the plane. The aim is to include methods that apply to remote
    sensing products (such as tree canopy maps). Consequently the methods focus on
    RACS that are observed only once, but relatively completely. The package is very
    dependent on SpatStat for many of the functions.
