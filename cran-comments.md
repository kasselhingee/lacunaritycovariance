Removed dependence on package envi. Hopefully this will resolve issues with M1 Mac check not finding envi.
That check also can't find the terra package, but I can't see why that would be the case and my check on macOS had no issue with terra (https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/results/1698722909-92781675bc9045e9/).

The note from the package check refers to a url in the package DESCRIPTION. It is the official URL for a core reference paper and the page loads well on my browsers.
