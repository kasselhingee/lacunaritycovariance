Attempt to resolve issue with M1 Mac check not finding 'envi' package.
I've removed dependence on envi completely.

The M1 Mac check also can't find the terra package, but I can't see why that would be the case and my check on using https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html found had no issue with terra.
