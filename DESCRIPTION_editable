Description: 
    Functions for estimating properties of random closed sets in 2D from binary maps and for simulating 2D Boolean models.
    Here a binary maps are usually taken to be a rasterised image with each pixel labelled TRUE, FALSE or NA, with NA representing unobserved pixels.
    A demo for extracting a such a binary map from geospatial data formats (e.g. presence-absence maps or two-class landcover maps) is provided.
    The binary map may also be represented in non-rasterised form using a polygonal set as the foreground.
    The gliding box estimator of mass variance lacunarity with improved estimators of mass variance lacunarity are included.
    Also included are anisotropic estimators of covariance, centred covariance and pair-correlation based on estimators proposed by Picka.
    The package is based on research conducted during the author's PhD studies.
