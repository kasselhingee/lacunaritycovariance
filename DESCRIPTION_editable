Description: 
    This package contains functions for estimating the gliding box lacunarity (GBL), covariance, and pair-correlation of a random closed set (RACS) in 2D from a binary coverage map.
    A number of newly-developed covariance-based estimators of GBL and 
    balanced estimators, proposed by Picka for covariance, centred covariance, and pair-correlation, are implemented in this package.
    Methods for estimating contagion-like properties of RACS and simulating 2D Boolean models are also included.
    In this package binary coverage maps are usually taken to be a rasterised image with each pixel labelled TRUE, FALSE or NA, with NA representing unobserved pixels.
    A demo for extracting a such a binary map from geospatial data formats (e.g. presence-absence maps or two-class landcover maps) is provided.
    The binary map may also be represented in non-rasterised form using a polygonal set as the foreground.
    This package is based on research conducted during the author's PhD studies.
