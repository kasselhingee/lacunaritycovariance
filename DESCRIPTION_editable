Description: 
    The package contains functions for estimating the gliding box lacunarity (GBL), covariance and pair-correlation of a random closed set (RACS) in 2D from a binary coverage map.
    It also includes methods for estimating contagion-like properties of RACS and simulating 2D Boolean models.
    Binary coverage maps are usually taken to be a rasterised image with each pixel labelled TRUE, FALSE or NA, with NA representing unobserved pixels.
    A demo for extracting a such a binary map from geospatial data formats (e.g. presence-absence maps or two-class landcover maps) is provided.
    The binary map may also be represented in non-rasterised form using a polygonal set as the foreground.
    A number of newly-developed covariance-based estimators of GBL are available in this package along with empirical GBL.
    The balanced estimators of covariance, centred covariance and pair-correlation proposed by Picka are available in this package.
    Further estimators for properties of random closed sets are available in the spatstat package.
    The package is based on research conducted during the author's PhD studies.
