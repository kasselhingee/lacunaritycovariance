TO DO BEFORE PUBLISHING:
- Flesh out relation between Hest and Bouligand-Minkowski

- Warning about assumptions of stationary and mixing

- Discussion on when to use the functions?

- Introduce or reference out Boolean Model

- Refer to the lacunarity paper?

- topic keywords of spatial and non-parametric

- Make it make sense to someone who isn't a spatial stats expert, to an ecologist, that I want to use it.
