TO DO BEFORE PUBLISHING:
___________________________
Really required:
D- Maintainer field

D- version number with non-leading zeros

- examples took a long time to process. Some 32 seconds!
gbl              32.728  0.056  32.821
gblcc            14.589  0.052  14.660
gblg              9.841  0.024   9.876
gblc              9.441  0.016   9.468
secondorderprops  5.889  0.000   5.895
rblnd             5.504  0.000   5.510

- build using R CMD build --compact-vignettes=gs+qpdf  ...

- A citation command that links to my paper or thesis ACT 1h

- Fill in references. ACT 1h

- p13 error: see link{}. ACT 10min

- fix overfull lines (about 10 of them). ACT 30min

- glbtrad description to: empirical Gliding Box, proposed by A and C [1]. And else where ACT 1h

- Change function names to reflect names `empirical GBL' or gliding box estimator, and plugin moment estimators  ACT 2h

- consistent naming ACT 1h

- More Picka references ACT: 30min


- tradcovarest require obswin. ACT 1h

Total ACT: 8h 
___________________________
Great for more polished publication:
- better indexing of topics. ACT 1h

- tests of summary properties of grain.lib. ACT 3h

- move covar.grainlib function to another help file  ACT 2h

- disc state contagion function that acts on binary map directly. ACT 2h

- Discussion on when to use the functions? Take 50% from thesis intro on pros and cons of summary functions. ACT 3h (to first smooth draft)

- Make it make sense to someone who isn't a spatial stats expert, to an ecologist, that I want to use it. ACT 3h (to first smooth draft)

##**feature request: a test that simulations rbllognorm correspond to theoretical values for the model. ACT 1h

##** add mean area contagion. And contagion for categorical maps. ACT 20h

- polish vignette? ACT 2h (to first smooth draft)


Total ACT: 37h

----------------------
Completed:
D- unit tests ACT 4h

D- make sure everything works on logically valued images (TRUE, FALSE, NA) created say using eval.im ACT 2h

D- syphon off estimation of cover in small window ACT 1.5h

D- syphon off helper functions never for release ACT 1.5h

D- scdcontag() --> contagdiscstate()? ACT 0.5h

D- setcov and imcov maintain units of input image - pass on to spatstat ACT 1h
