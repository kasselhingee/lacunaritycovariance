TO DO BEFORE PUBLISHING:
- Discussion on when to use the functions?

- Make it make sense to someone who isn't a spatial stats expert, to an ecologist, that I want to use it.

##**feature request: a test that simulations rbllognorm correspond to theoretical values for the model.

- polish vignette?

- setcov and imcov maintain units of input image - pass on to spatstat

- improve on title
