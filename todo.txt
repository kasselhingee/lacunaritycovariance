TO DO BEFORE PUBLISHING:
- unit tests

- make sure everything works on logically valued images (TRUE, FALSE, NA) created say using eval.im

- syphon off estimation of cover in small window

- syphon off helper functions never for release

- scdcontag() --> contagdiscstate()?

- setcov and imcov maintain units of input image - pass on to spatstat

- consistent naming

- Discussion on when to use the functions? Take 50% from thesis intro on pros and cons of summary functions.

- Make it make sense to someone who isn't a spatial stats expert, to an ecologist, that I want to use it.

##**feature request: a test that simulations rbllognorm correspond to theoretical values for the model.

- polish vignette?
