TO DO BEFORE PUBLISHING:
- Discussion on when to use the functions?

- Make it make sense to someone who isn't a spatial stats expert, to an ecologist, that I want to use it.

- delete demo things?

- covariance -- racscovariance

- use testhat package

- in mvlgb: catch warnings about empty RS window and print something more understandble

##**feature request: a test that simulations rbllognorm correspond to theoretical values for the model.

- mvlgb and mvlc interface more matching!?

- make tests less computationally intensive somehow!?

- apply lintr to tests
