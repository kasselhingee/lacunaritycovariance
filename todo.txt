TO DO BEFORE PUBLISHING:
- Discussion on when to use the functions?

- Make it make sense to someone who isn't a spatial stats expert, to an ecologist, that I want to use it.

- delete demo things?

- in mvlgb: catch warnings about empty RS window and print something more understandble

##**feature request: a test that simulations rbllognorm correspond to theoretical values for the model.

- mvlgb and mvlc interface more matching!?

- make tests less computationally intensive somehow!?

- polish vignette?

- setcov and imcov maintain units of input image - pass on to spatstat

- mvlc test doesn't need to recalculate covariance when it is tested somewhere else
