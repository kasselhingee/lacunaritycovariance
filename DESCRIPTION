Description: Methods for non-parametric estimation of 2D RACS properties from
    observations. This class of properties have various names depending on the
    field, including landscape pattern indices (from landscape ecology),
    pattern metrics and spatial statistical summary functions.  The methods are
    designed to apply to bi-tonal images, such as two-class land cover maps
    derived from remotely sensed data, and focus on extracting properties from 
    a single observation. Currently all estimators assume that the RACS is
    stationary and mixing, and that the observation is sufficiently large
	compared to the spatial dependence of the RACS. The package depends heavily
	on tools provided by the spatstat package.
