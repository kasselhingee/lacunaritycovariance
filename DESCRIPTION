Description:  Functions for estimating the gliding box
    lacunarity (GBL), covariance, and pair-correlation of a random closed
    set (RACS) in 2D from a binary coverage map (e.g. presence-absence
    land cover maps).  There are a number of newly-developed
    covariance-based estimators of GBL and balanced estimators, proposed
    by Picka, for covariance, centred covariance, and pair-correlation.
    There are also methods for estimating contagion-like properties of
    RACS and simulating 2D Boolean models.  Binary coverage maps are
    usually represented as raster images with pixel values of TRUE, FALSE
    or NA, with NA representing unobserved pixels.  A demo for extracting
    a such a binary map from a geospatial data format is provided.  Binary
    maps may also be represented using polygonal sets as the foreground,
    however for most computations such maps are converted into raster
    images.  The package is based on research conducted during the
    author's PhD studies.
