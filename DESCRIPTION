Description: This package augments the package spatstat with some additional
    functions that estimate summary characteristics of 2D RAndom Closed Sets (RACS).
    Summary characteristics of RACS are used in landscape ecology (as landscape
	pattern indices), fractal analysis (to estimate dimension), stereology and many
	other fields. The methods within this package are designed to apply to bi-tonal
	images, such as two-class land cover maps derived from remotely sensed data.
    Currently all estimators assume that the RACS is stationary and mixing, and that
	the observation window is much larger than the range of dependence between
	spatial locations. The package also includes methods for computing summary
    characteristics of Boolean models and simulating Boolean models.
