Description: Methods for non-parametric estimation of 2D RACS properties from
    observations. These sort of methods have various names depending on the
    field, including landscape pattern indices (from landscape ecology),
    pattern metrics and spatial statistical summary functions.  The methods are
    designed to apply to bi-tonal images, such as two-class land cover maps
    derived from remotely sensed data, and focus on extracting properties from 
    a single observation. Currently all methods pretend that the RACS is
    stationary. The package depends heavily on tools provided by the spatstat
    package.
