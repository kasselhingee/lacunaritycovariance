Description: This package augments the package spatstat
    with some additional functions that estimate summary characteristics
    of 2D RAndom Closed Sets (RACS).  Summary characteristics of RACS are
    used in landscape ecology (as landscape pattern indices), fractal
    analysis (to estimate dimension), stereology and many other fields.
    The methods within this package are designed to apply to bi-tonal
    images, such as two-class land cover maps derived from remotely sensed
    data.  Currently all estimators assume that the RACS is stationary and
    mixing, and that the observation window is much larger than the range
    of dependence between spatial locations. The package also includes
    methods for computing summary characteristics of Boolean models and
    simulating Boolean models.
