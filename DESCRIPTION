Description: Functions for non-parametric estimation of 2D RACS properties from
    observations. The aim is to develop methods that apply to bitonal images, such
    as two-class land cover maps derived from remotely sensed data. The methods
    focus on extracting properties from a single observation. Currently all of
    the methods pretend that the RACS is stationary. Most of the functions depend
    heavily on the tools made available by the spatstat package.
