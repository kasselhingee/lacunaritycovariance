<<<<<<< HEAD

This is an R package for estimating gliding box lacunarity and other RACS properties. This directory contains the source code of this package.

## Installation
Install from .tar.gz form of this directory: Inside an R session run
    install.packages("<PATH>", repos = NULL, type = "source")

where <PATH> is the path to the .tar.gz file.

*or* 

Install from GitHub using devtools package:

This directory contains the source code of the R package *stationaryracsinference*. This R package is for estimating gliding box lacunarity and other RACS properties from spatial binary maps (images composed of binary-valued pixels). 

## Installation
### From GitHub using devtools package:
From inside an R interactive session run:

>>>>>>> master
    library(devtools)
    install_github("kasselhingee/racsstats", ref = "release", auth_token = "****")

where auth_token is required until the GitHub repository is made public. If you have a GitHub account then, after getting permission from Kassel Hingee, you can obtain an auth_token by going to this website: https://github.com/settings/tokens.
 Copy the personal access token from your browser and use it as the auth_token argument of install_github.

### Install from source code not in .tar.gz form
First run the following to build a .tar.gz file.

    R CMD build . 

This should create a file "stationaryracsinference-VERSION.tar.gz".
Then run 

    R CMD INSTALL stationaryracsinference-VERSION.tar.gz

>>>>>>> master
## Further Notes
### Manual pages
The manual pages for each function (in man/) and the file NAMESPACE have been generated using roxygen2. To edit these, edit the specially formatted comments in the files in the directory R/, then regenerate the manual pages and NAMESPACE function by running roxygen2::roxygenise() from an R session with the working directory at the root of the package directory.
